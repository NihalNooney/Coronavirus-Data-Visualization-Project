# Coronavirus-Data-Visualization-Project


 A Java/Android Studio Application which displays details regarding the number of 1st dose & 2nd dose vaccines allocated in different U.S states and territories. Utilizes multiple APIs to fetch information and efficiently display it on a user-friendly interface. Users are given a brief description of the application through events based on Firebase and are directed to the home page where they're able to search up any state/territory in the U.S they'd like to see. The vaccine allocations are then presented and thereafter code using AnyChart will graph it along a bar chart where users can compare vaccine allocations for multiple locations.
