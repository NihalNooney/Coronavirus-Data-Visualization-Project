# Coronavirus-Data-Visualization-Project

<h2>Summary</h2>
 A Java/Android Studio Application which displays details regarding the number of 1st dose & 2nd dose vaccines allocated in different U.S states and territories. Utilizes multiple APIs to fetch information and efficiently display it on a user-friendly interface. Users are given a brief description of the application through events based on Firebase and are directed to the home page where they're able to search up any state/territory in the U.S they'd like to see. The vaccine allocations are then presented and thereafter code using AnyChart will graph it along a bar chart where users can compare vaccine allocations for multiple locations.
 <br>
 <h2>How it works</h2>
 This Android application uses user input to search through the CDC.gov API in order to display first and second dose allocations of the SARS-COV2 virus in the U.S.A and its allocated territories. This information is stored in a JSON and fed through Android-Studio provided methods. Thereafter, this information is fed through a seperate class for AnyChart data visualization. In the project itself, a bar chart was used but a pie chart is also incorporated into the code.
